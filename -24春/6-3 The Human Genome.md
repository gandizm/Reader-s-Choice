# **The Human Genome**

The human genome is the genetic code contained in the tightly coiled strands of 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell's nucleus.

The Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics have been racing to be the first to decode the three billion base pairs that make up the human genome and to identify genes revealed in the process.

**Chromosomes**

Mostly made of long chains of a chemical called DNA, chromosomes carry thousands of genes, the specific portions of DNA that contain hereditary instructions.

**DNA**

The hereditary instructions of genes are written in a four-letter code. Each letter corresponds to one of the chemical components of DNA: A, G, C, T.

A ADENINE

T THYMINE

G GUANINE

C CYTOSINE

The bases are linked so that A always links to T, and C always links to G.

**Gene discovery**

To find genes, computer programs have been developed that search the raw sequence for characteristic patterns of As, Ts, Cs and Gs.

The genes are scattered in portions along the DNA, but are read as whole sets of hereditary instructions.

DNA SEQUENCE

_A T A T A T A T A T A_

ISOLATED GENE

_A T A T A T ==A T A T A_==

Scientists hope identifying disease-causing genes will improve detection and treatment of the disease and offer new approaches for prevention. There are up to 40,000 genes in the human genome.

**Complete reports online**

The world's two leading scientific Journals are publishing reports by the competing teams online today. Science magazine is publishing the work by the private company Celera. Nature is publishing the work of an international public consortium.
