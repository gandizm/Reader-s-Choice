# **Grains of Hope**

**Genetically engineered crops could revolutionize farming. Protesters fear they could also destroy the ecosystem. You decide.**

**By J. Madeleine Nash**

 1      At first, the grains of rice that Ingo Potrykus held in his fingers did not seem at all special, but inside, these grains were not white, as ordinary rice is, but a very pale yellow—thanks to beta-carotene, a building block for vitamin A.

 2      Potrykus was elated. For more than a decade he had dreamed of creating a golden rice that could improve the lives of millions of the poorest people in the world, strengthening their eyesight and their resistance to disease.

 3      He saw his rice as the start of a new green revolution in which ancient food crops would gain all sorts of useful properties: bananas that wouldn't rot on the way to market; corn that could supply its own fertilizer; wheat that could grow even during a drought.

 4      But imagining golden rice was one thing and creating one quite another. Year after year, Potrykus and his colleagues ran into one obstacle after another until success finally came in the spring of 1999.

 5      At that point, he tackled an even greater challenge. The golden grains contained pieces of DNA borrowed from bacteria and flowers. It was what some would call _Frankenfood_, a product of genetic engineering. As such, it was caught in a web of hopes and fears.

 6      Golden grain has brought attention to a growing public debate. Are genetically modified crops (GM crops) a technological leap forward that will have extraordinary benefits for the world and its people? Or do they represent a dangerous step towards ecological and agricultural ruin? Is genetic engineering just a more efficient way of doing traditional crossbreeding? Or does the ability to mix the genes of any species—even plants and animals— give humans more power than they should have?

 7      The debate began the moment genetically engineered crops were first sold in the 1990s, and it has escalated ever since. First to start major protests against biotechnology were European environmentalists and consumer-advocacy groups. They were soon followed by their U.S. counterparts.

 8      The hostility is understandable. Most of the GM crops introduced so far have been developed for one of two purposes: either to produce a plant resistant to insect pests or a plant resistant to the chemicals that farmers use to kill weeds in their fields. These genetically engineered crops are often sold by the same large, multinational corporations that produce and sell the weed-killing chemicals that farmers spray on their fields. Consumers have become suspicious. Why use a strange new technology that might cause ecological damage, they ask, when the benefits of doing so seem small?

 9      The benefits did seem small until golden rice was developed. It is the first strong example of a GM crop that may benefit not just the farmers who grow it but also the consumers who eat it. In this case, the consumers include at least a million children who die every year because they are weakened by vitamin-A deficiency and an additional 350,000 who go blind.

 10    Many people worried about poverty and hunger look at golden rice and see it as evidence that GM crops can be made to serve the greater public good. They see a critical role for GM crops in feeding the world's ever-increasing population. As former U.S. President Jimmy Carter put it, "Responsible biotechnology is not the enemy; starvation is."

 11    Indeed by the year 2020, the demand for grain is projected to go up by nearly half, while the amount of land available for farming will probably decrease. Also, there will be a greater need to conserve water and reduce polluting chemicals. The challenges are enormous.

 12    In order to meet them, believes Gordon Conway, the agricultural ecologist who heads the Rockefeller Foundation. 21st century farmers will have to take advantage of everything available to them to produce more food, including genetic engineering. And contrary to what the public believes, he says, those who have the least to lose and the most to gain are not well-fed Americans and Europeans but hungry citizens of the developing world.

**Weighing the Perils**

 13    Even proponents of agricultural biotechnology agree, though, that there are a number of real concerns about GM foods. First, all foods, including GM foods, are potential sources of allergens. That's because genes transferred in the process of making GM foods contain instructions for making proteins Some—those in peanuts, for example — are well known for causing allergic reactions. To many, the possibility that golden rice might cause such a problem seems extremely unlikely, but it still needs to be considered.

 14    Then there is the problem of "genetic pollution," as opponents of biotechnology term it. Pollen from wind-pollinated plants, such as corn and canola. is carried far and wide, Genetically-modified canola grown in one field, for example, can very easily pollinate non-GM plants grown in another field. This alarmed European farmers and led to protests when it was discovered that canola seeds from Canada unknowingly planted by European farmers contained transgenic Contaminants.
 
 15    Other arguments center around Bt corn and cotton—now grown in the U.S., Argentina, and China. Bt stands for a common soil bacteria, _Bacillus thuringiensis_. Bt produces poisons that affect certain insects. Monsanto and other companies have produced crops that are resistant to these insects by transferring into them the bacterial genes that produce specific insect poisons. Some ecologists worry, though, that planting these Bt crops will lead to the development of insects that have a resistance to Bt. That would be unfortunate, they say, because Bt is a safe and effective natural insecticide that is popular with organic farmers.

 16    Even more worrisome are ecological concerns. In his laboratory in 1999, Cornell University entomologist John Losey dusted Bt corn pollen on plants populated by monarch-butterfly caterpillars. Many of the caterpillars died. Could what happened in Losey's laboratory happen in cornfields across the Midwest?

 17    Although there have been studies done, there is as yet no clear answer to this question. Losey himself is not yet convinced that Bt corn is harmful to North America's monarch butterfly population, but he does think the issue deserves attention.

 18    And others agree. "I'm not anti-biotechnology _per se_" says biologist Rebecca Goldberg, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, but she would like there to be stronger laws regarding these crops and more study of them before they are sold.
 
 19    Are there more potential problems? One is the possibility that pollen drifting from GM crops will fertilize wild plants, making stronger weeds that are even more difficult to control. No one knows how likely this is to happen, but Margaret Mellon, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' agriculture and biotechnology program, and others like her believe that it's time we find out. Says she: "People should be responding to these concerns with experiments, not assurances."

 20    And that is beginning to happen, although—contrary to expectations—the reports coming in are not that scary. For three years now. University of Arizona entomologist Bruce Tabashnik has been monitoring fields of Bt cotton that farmers have planted in his state. And in this instance, he says, "the environmental risks seem minimal, and the benefits seem great." Tabashnik says that Arizona farmers have reduced their use of chemical insecticides 75%. So far, there is no evidence that insects have become resistant to Bt either.

**Assessing the Promise**

 21    Are the critics of agricultural biotechnology right? Are the supposed benefits of biotechnology just corporate advertising? Papaya growers in Hawaii disagree. In 1992 a virus threatened to destroy the state's papaya industry. By 1994, nearly half the state's papaya crop had been infected. But then help arrived, in the form of a virus-resistant GM papaya developed by Cornell University plant pathologist Dennis Gonsalves.
 
 22    In 1995, scientists planted a trial field of regular papaya plants and two types of transgenic papaya. The regular papaya plants in the field trial failed to grow, but the GM plants were healthy. In 1998, the papaya growers switched to the GM seeds. "Consumer acceptance has been great," reports Rusty Perry, who runs a papaya farm near Puna. "We've found that customers are more concerned with how the fruits look and taste than with whether they are transgenic or not."
 
 23    In Africa, viral diseases and insects are major causes of crop loss. Kenyan plant scientist Florence Wambugu hopes to improve the sweet potato crop yield there by introducing a GM sweet potato that is resistant to the feathery mottle virus. To Wambugu, the argument in the U.S. and Europe about GM crops seems almost ridiculous. In Africa, she notes, nearly half the fruit and vegetable harvest is lost because it rots on the way to market. "If we had a transgenic banana that ripened more slowly," she says, "we could have 40% more bananas than now." Wambugu also dreams of getting herbicide resistant crops. Says she: "We could liberate so many people if our crops were resistant to herbicides that we could then spray on the surrounding weeds. Weeding enslaves Africans; it keeps children from school."

 24    The popular belief that agricultural biotechnology is bad for the environment puzzles the Rockefeller Foundation's Conway. He sees genetic engineering as an important tool for achieving a "doubly green revolution." If technology can increase a plant's natural defenses against weeds and viruses, if it can make crops grow using only small amounts of chemical fertilizers or in drought-ridden land, then what's wrong with it?
