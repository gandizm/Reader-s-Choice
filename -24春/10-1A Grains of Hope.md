# **Grains of Hope**

**Genetically engineered crops could revolutionize farming. Protesters fear they could also destroy the ecosystem. You decide.**

 1      At first, the grains of rice that Ingo Potrykus held in his fingers did not seem at all special, but inside, these grains were not white, as ordinary rice is, but a very pale yellow—thanks to beta-carotene, a building block for vitamin A.

 2      Potrykus was elated. For more than a decade he had dreamed of creating a golden rice that could improve the lives of millions of the poorest people in the world, strengthening their eyesight and their resistance to disease.

 3      He saw his rice as the start of a new green revolution in which ancient food crops would gain all sorts of useful properties: bananas that wouldn't rot on the way to market; corn that could supply its own fertilizer; wheat that could grow even during a drought.

 4      But imagining golden rice was one thing and creating one quite another. Year after year, Potrykus and his colleagues ran into one obstacle after another until success finally came in the spring of 1999.

 5      At that point, he tackled an even greater challenge. The golden grains contained pieces of DNA borrowed from bacteria and flowers. It was what some would call _Frankenfood_, a product of genetic engineering. As such, it was caught in a web of hopes and fears.

 6      Golden grain has brought attention to a growing public debate. Are genetically modified crops (GM crops) a technological leap forward that will have extraordinary benefits for the world and its people? Or do they represent a dangerous step towards ecological and agricultural ruin? Is genetic engineering just a more efficient way of doing traditional crossbreeding? Or does the ability to mix the genes of any species—even plants and animals— give humans more power than they should have?

 7      The debate began the moment genetically engineered crops were first sold in the 1990s, and it has escalated ever since. First to start major protests against biotechnology were European environmentalists and consumer-advocacy groups. They were soon followed by their U.S. counterparts.

 8      The hostility is understandable. Most of the GM crops introduced so far have been developed for one of two purposes: either to produce a plant resistant to insect pests or a plant resistant to the chemicals that farmers use to kill weeds in their fields. These genetically engineered crops are often sold by the same large, multinational corporations that produce and sell the weed-killing chemicals that farmers spray on their fields. Consumers have become suspicious. Why use a strange new technology that might cause ecological damage, they ask, when the benefits of doing so seem small?

 9      The benefits did seem small until golden rice was developed. It is the first strong example of a GM crop that may benefit not just the farmers who grow it but also the consumers who eat it. In this case, the consumers include at least a million children who die every year because they are weakened by vitamin-A deficiency and an additional 350,000 who go blind.

 10    Many people worried about poverty and hunger look at golden rice and see it as evidence that GM crops can be made to serve the greater public good. They see a critical role for GM crops in feeding the world's ever-increasing population. As former U.S. President Jimmy Carter put it, "Responsible biotechnology is not the enemy; starvation is."

 11    Indeed by the year 2020, the demand for grain is projected to go up by nearly half, while the amount of land available for farming will probably decrease. Also, there will be a greater need to conserve water and reduce polluting chemicals. The challenges are enormous.

 12    In order to meet them, believes Gordon Conway, the agricultural ecologist who heads the Rockefeller Foundation. 21st century farmers will have to take advantage of everything available to them to produce more food, including genetic engineering. And contrary to what the public believes, he says, those who have the least to lose and the most to gain are not well-fed Americans and Europeans but hungry citizens of the developing world.

**Weighing the Perils**

 13    Even proponents of agricultural biotechnology agree, though, that there are a number of real concerns about GM foods. First, all foods, including GM foods, are potential sources of allergens. That's because genes transferred in the process of making GM foods contain instructions for making proteins Some—those in peanuts, for example — are well known for causing allergic reactions. To many, the possibility that golden rice might cause such a problem seems extremely unlikely, but it still needs to be considered.

 14    Then there is the problem of "genetic pollution," as opponents of biotechnology term it. Pollen from wind-pollinated plants, such as corn and canola. is carried far and wide, Genetically-modified canola grown m one field, for example. can very easily pollinate non-GM plants grown in another field. This alarmed European farmers and led to protests when it was discovered that canola seeds from Canada unknowingly planted by European farmers contained transgenic Contaminants.
