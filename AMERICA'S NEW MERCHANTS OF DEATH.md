**AMERICA'S NEW MERCHANTS OF DEATH**

1.       IN GERMANY, three women in black miniskirts set up a table beside a Cadillac in the center of Dresden. In exchange for an empty pack of local cigarettes, they offer passersby a pack of Lucky Strikes and a leaflet that reads: "You just got hold of a nice piece of America. Lucky Strike is the original... a real classic." Says German physician Bernhard Humburger, who studies youth smoking, "Adolescents time and again receive cigarettes at such promotions."

2.       • A Jeep decorated with the yellow Camel logo pulls up in front of a high school in Buenos Aires. The driver, a blond woman, begins handing out cigarettes to 15- and 16-year-olds during their lunch break.

3.       • In Malaysia, a man responds to a television commercial for "Salem High Country Holidays." When he tries to book a trip, he is refused; the $2.5-million-ayear operation exists only to advertise Salem on TV. This promotes Salem cigarettes without breaking the law.

4.       • At a video arcade in Taipei, free U.S. cigarettes lie atop each game. "As long as they're here, I may as well try one," says a high-school girl in a Chicago Bears T-shirt. Before the United States entered the Taiwanese cigarette market, such giveaways were uncommon at places frequented by adolescents.

5.       A Reader's Digest investigation covering 20 countries on five continents has revealed that millions of children are being lured into nicotine addiction by U.S. cigarette makers. In several nations, U.S. tobacco companies have being fighting laws that curtail cigarette use by young people and are cleverly violating the spirit of the curbs on advertising. Their activities clearly show a disregard for public health.

6.       But the most shocking finding is that children are being lured into smoking in . the name of the United States itself. In some countries, tobacco companies never would have gotten a start without the help of a powerful ally: the U.S. government.

7.       Although domestic sales have dropped for eight straight years, and by the year 2000 only one in seven people in the U.S. will likely smoke, sales outside the U.S. have more than tripled since 1985. Smoking rates in developing countries are climbing more than two percent a year. Most troubling is the rise in youth smoking. In the Philippines, 22.7 percent of people under 18 smoke. In some Latin American cities, the teenage rate is a shocking 50 percent. In Hong Kong, children as young as seven are smoking.

8.       Why are the young so important? Because millions of adult smokers either kick their habit or die each year, the cigarette industry depends on attracting new customers. Most smokers begin between ages 12 and 16; if a young person hasn't begun by 18, he or she is unlikely ever to smoke.

9.       "Tobacco is a growth industry, and we are gaining in volume and share in markets around the world," Philip Morris assured stockholders in its 1991 annual report.

10.    "Growth prospects internationally have never been better," reported Dale Sisel, chief executive officer of R.J. Reynolds (RJR) Tobacco International at last summer's international tobacco conference in Raleigh, N.C. "We all produce and sell a legal product that more than one billion consumers around the world use every single day."

11.    Unmentioned at the conference was the fact that smoking is one of the leading causes of premature death, linked to cancers of the mouth, lung, esophagus, kidney pancreas, bladder, and cervix, as well as to heart disease. Or that. according to the World Health Organization, tobacco wll prematurely kill 200 million who are now children and eventually wipe out ten percent of the world's population. This grim prospect is due in no small part to the spectacular U.S. invasion of international markets.

12.    "The American people need to know precisely how their companies and government are promoting smoking among the world's children," says Dr. Carlos Ferreyra Nunez, president of the Argentine Association of Public Health. "If they knew the full story, I believe they would stop this outrage."

13.    Here is that story.

**Pervasive Influence**

14.    TOBACCO ADVERTISING is more pervasive in other parts of the world than in the U.S. African merchants can get their shops painted to look like a pack of Marlboros. The Camel logo appears on store awnings and taxis in Warsaw. Christmas trees in Malaysian discos are decorated free by Kent — with balls and stars bearing the Kent logo. In Mexico, one in five TV commercials is for cigarettes. On an average day, 60 spots for U.S. brands appear on Japanese TV, many of them during programs watched by teens.

15.    Although their marketing budgets are secret, tobacco companies have increased their spending for international advertising, adding substantially to the $4 billion spent yearly in the United States. "It's crucial for them," says Richard Pollay, professor of marketing at the University of British Columbia. "Familiarity in advertising leads to trust."

16.    Tobacco spokespeople insist tint cigarette advertising draws only people who already smoke. But an ad executive who worked until recently on the Philip Morns account disagrees "You don't have to be a genius to figure out what's going on. Just look at the ads. It's ridiculous for them to deny that a cartoon character like Joe Camel isn't attractive to kids."

17.    Dr. John L. Clowe, president of the American Medical Association, says, "It is clear that advertising encourages tobacco use among children. And, despite tobacco-industry denials, ads like Joe Camel are especially appealing to adolescents, equating smoking with sex, athleticism, even success."

18.    Numerous independent studies support this view. Time and again they have shown that cigarette advertising creates an environment in which young people are more likely to smoke. That may explain why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control found that smokers between ages 12 and 18 prefer Marlboro, Newport and Camel — three of the most advertised brands.

**Brand-Stretching**

19.    LIKE THE UNITED STATES, some developing countries have banned cigarette commercials on TV and radio. This doesn't stop the tobacco companies, however. To keep their logos before the public, they use "brand-stretching"— advertising nontobacco products and services named after their brands. Most of these items have special appeal to young people: Marlboro jeans and jackets, for example.

20.    In Malaysia, a music store called Salem Power Station wraps customers' tapes and CDs in plastic bags bearing the Salem logo, and television carries on MTV-like show called "Salem Power-hits ." A Budapest radio station broadcasts a rock program called the Marlboro Hit Parade, and in China. Philip Morns sponsors the Marlboro American Musk Hour Rock concerts are especially effective.

21.    Sports sponsorship is even more insidious, tor it implies that smoking and fitness mix. Tobacco logos appear at events of every description, from cycling in Morocco to badminton in Indonesia. There's the Salem Open Tennis Tournament in Hong Kong and the Kent International Sailing Regatta, to name just two. U.S. tobacco companies spent $100 million sponsoring sports last year.

22.    Tobacco companies regularly skirt laws against TV commercials. In Shanghai, Philip Morris sponsors spots for "The World of Marlboro." Except that cigarettes aren't mentioned, they are identical to a Marlboro commercial: the Marlboro man and his horse splash across a stream, the man dismounts and gazes toward mountains that look like the Rockies.

23.    Unfortunately, many of the children who succumb to brand-stretching find habits that begin as cobwebs end up as steel cables. At a McDonald's in Malaysia, Sunil Ramanathan, 16, finishes off a Big Mac, lights a Marlboro and inhales deeply. He says he's smoked since he was ten. "I know smoking is bad for me, but I can't stop. I try to quit, but after one day I start again."

**Easy Access**

24.    JUST OFF Taipei's busy Keelung Road, high-school students begin arriving at the Whiskey A Go-Go disco about 9 p.m., and soon the room is a sea of denim. On each table are free packs of Salems. Before long, the place is full of smoke .

25.    "American tobacco companies spend more than a quarter of a billion dollars every year giving away cigarettes, many of which are smoked by children and teenagers," says Joe Tye, editor of the newsletter Tobacco Free Youth Reporter, "If they can get a youngster to smoke a few packs, chances are he'll be a customer for life."

26.    Of the seven under-18 students assembled at the Beltram High School in Buenos Aires, five say they have been offered free Camels. None was asked his age. One, Ruben Paz, 16, said he got his from a "blond, American- looking girl" handing out cigarettes from "the Camel Jeep" at the school door.

**Sell America**

27.    "MANY AFRICAN children have two hopes," says Paul Wangai, a physician in Nairobi, Kenya. "One is to go to heaven, the other to America. U.S. tobacco companies profit from this by associating smoking with wealth. It's not uncommon to hear children say they start because of the glamorous lifestyle associated with smoking."

28.    Cigarette advertising outside the United States focuses heavily on U.S. lifestyles; indeed, the ads are seen as a way of learning about the United States itself. A letter from secretarial students in China appeared in the Petaluma, California, Argus-Courier: "Every day we listen to the Marlboro Music Hour. We enjoy Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson. We smoke American cigarettes and wear American clothes. We are eager to gain more information about American life."

29.    To hear the children of the rest of the world tell it, everyone in the U.S. smokes. The truth is, the United States has one of the lowest smoking rates—25.5 percent of the population .

30.    Yet because of advertising, U.S. cigarettes are considered a sign of style and sophistication. In Bangkok, young Thais sew Marlboro logos on their jackets and jeans. At the city's Wat Nai Rong High School, 17-yearold Wasana Warathongchai says smoking makes her feel "sophisticated and cosmopolitan, like America." She associates Marlboros with "jeans and denim jackets, Pizza Hut, everything we like about America."

**Friends in High Places**

31.    THE THEME of last summer's Raleigh conference was "The Tobacco Industry to the Year 2000," and on ' hand were two experts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help the industry sell tobacco overseas .

32.    ...Wait a minute. Didn't the U.S. government decide in 1964 that cigarettes are a major cause of death and disease, and doesn't the U.S. government discourage its own citizens from smoking? Then how can we encourage people of other nations to smoke?

33.    For many years, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand imposed strong trade restrictions on imported cigarettes. But U.S. tobacco companies joined forces with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to enter these Asian markets .

34.    The weapon Washington has used was Section 301 of the old Trade Act of 1974. It empowers the USTR to retaliate— with punitive tariffs — against any nation thought to have imposed unfair barriers on U.S. products .

35.    Here is a recent example. When the USTR began an investigation of Japanese trading practices, a U.S. senator stepped in on behalf of the tobacco industry. He sent a letter to the Japanese prime minister suggesting he could not support a substantial U.S. military presence in the Pacific or help change anti-Japanese trade attitudes in Congress unless Japan opened its cigarette market .

36.    "I urge that you establish a timetable for allowing U.S. cigarettes a specific share of your market," the senator wrote. "I suggest a total of 20 percent within 18 months." Three months later, the Japanese government agreed to open its markets more .

37.    The results have been devastating. Before the U.S. tobacco companies arrived, smoking rates were declining slightly in Japan, but in the past five years, cigarette consumption by minors has increased 16 percent. Among Taiwanese high-school students, the smoking rate climbed 14 percent. The number of Thai smokers ages 15 to 19 increased 24 percent, with similar increases for Korean school boys .

38.    "We were making progress in discouraging smoking, but all has been washed away by the flood of American advertising," says David D. Yen, chair of an antismoking group in Taiwan. "We want your friendship, but not your tobacco."

39.    The U.S. cigarette business is booming. Exports are soaring, factories being built. And at the end of the rainbow lies China, with 300 million smokers—30 percent of the world market .

40.    "This vastly larger marketplace means a whole new world of opportunities," RJR's Dale Sisel told the Raleigh conference. Expansion abroad, he continued, would "pave the way for a bigger and brighter future."

41.    That kind of talk makes Argentina's Dr. Ferreyra Nunez shake with anger. "U.S. tobacco companies know their product causes death. Yet they promote smoking among children. What must these people think? Don't they have children of their own?"

**You Can Stop This Outrage**

42.    PUBLIC OPINION is more powerful than the tobacco lobby If you agree that it's wrong for the United States to promote the sale abroad of a health hazard that we discourage at home, write a letter to the President. Ask him to order the United States Trade Representative to stop helping the tobacco companies open cigarette markets overseas. Urge him to support curbs on tobacco advertising in other countries like those already in place here. And send copies of your letter to your Representatives in Congress .

43.    The President's address is The White House, Washington, D.C . 20500. (Fax number: 202:555-2461)
