**Smoking in Public: Live and Let Live**

Ours is a big world, complex and full of many diverse people. People with many varying points of view are constantly running up against others who have differing opinions. Those of us who smoke are just one group of many. Recently, the activism of nonsmokers has reminded us of the need to be considerate of others when we smoke in public.

 But, please! Enough is enough! We would like to remind nonsmokers that courtesy is a two-way street. If you politely request that someone not smoke you are more likely to receive a cooperative response than if you scowl fiercely and hurl insults. If you speak directly to someone, you are more likely to get what you want than if you complain to the management.

 Many of us have been smoking for so long that we sometimes forget that others are not used to the aroma of burning tobacco. We're human, and like everyone else we occasionally offend unknowingly. But most of us are open to friendly suggestions and comments and quite willing to modify our behavior to accommodate others.

 Smokers are people, too. We laugh and cry. We have hopes, dreams, aspirations. We have children, and mothers, and pets. We eat hamburgers with everything on them and salute the flag at Fourth of July picnics. We hope you'll remember that the next time a smoker lights up in public.

 **Just a friendly reminder from your local Smokers' Rights Association.**
